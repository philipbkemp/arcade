# Phil's Arcade
What better way to practice some good old JavaScript than with an arcade website. Classic games, plus a few new ones.
Everything here is pure CSS, JS, and HTML. Nothing fancy. Except maybe an Ajax call to ping my own web tracker so I know how many people are playing on my arcade.

## What games do you have on your phone?
None, yet.
But I have a whole bunch of ideas. One game at a time, the arcade will grow and grow.
